# QG-Terminal
An open source finance/trading dashboard, By defualt this project is tailored to fit my own personal needs for keeping up with financial markets. This platform is mainly python with CSS, and HTML making it very easy to customize it to suit your own personal desired use with a little python and web knowledge.

# Data
You have to source your own market data as it's expensive :( and this is a free project. 
I have scavenged many free resources and created bots to keep it updated this includes news, economic data, interest rates, and many more
