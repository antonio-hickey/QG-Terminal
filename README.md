# QG-Terminal
Open Source finance/trading dashboard (python web app). By defualt this project is tailored to fit my own personal needs for keeping up with financial markets. This platform is mainly Python and CSS, making it very easy to customize it to suit your own desired use with little python and web knowledge.

# Data
